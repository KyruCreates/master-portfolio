  <div class="music">
    <h1>Music</h1>
    <p>Placeholder: This is the music page for all the music work I've done (main for student projects) posted on SoundCloud (and eventually YouTube).</p>
    <p>Somehow this will also show previews for the musescore projects (a sheet music writing program).</p>
