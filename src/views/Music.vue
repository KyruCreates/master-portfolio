<!--
TO DO:
  1. Add SoundCloud API (or make a simple music player with files).

<template>
  <div class="music">
    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>Placeholder: This is the music page for all the music work I've done (main for student projects) posted on SoundCloud (using SoundCloud api).</p>
    <p>Somehow this will also show previews for the musescore projects (a sheet music writing program).</p>
  </div>
</template>
