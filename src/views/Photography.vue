<!--
TO DO:
  1. Add Flickr API to populate the page
    1a. Handle errors for API request
  2. Assuming the data is a list:
    2a. Use a v-for loop to display the list elements on the page
    2b. Build a new component that will be used for each list element
    2c. That component should accept at least four props and use props validation (required and data type)
  3. If the data isn't a list:
    3a. At least 4 pieces of data from the API must be displayed
    3b. There must be conditional content displayed based on value of some returned data

  BONUS: Create UI interactions to modify/interact with your API data
